There is only one code file- final_code.R.
Right click on the code file and open the file with ‘R Studio’.
Set the working directory by clicking on ‘Session’ in the RStudio tool bar.
After opening the code, install the libraries that I have used in the code using the function-
install.packages(‘package-name’)
The packages that I have used in the code are as follows:
library(data.table) 1.12.2
library(ggplot2) 3.2.1
library(plyr) 1.8.4
library(dplyr) 0.8.3
library(corrplot) 0.84
library(glmnet) 
library(caret) 6.0-84
library(dummies) 1.5.6
library(randomForest) 4.6-14
library(MLmetrics) 1.1.1
